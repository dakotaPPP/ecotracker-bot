# Python Discord Bot

Hello this bot tracks "eco kills" for a specified player!!
In order to get this bot running I recommending changing the line "bot.run(os.getenv("TOKEN"))" in main.py to include your bot's actual token.
If you don't want our preset users in the user_data.db table feel free to delete them.
